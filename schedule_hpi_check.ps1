# ---- 2026-08-12: own the task PRINCIPAL, don't leave it Interactive ---------
# schtasks.exe (above) can only ever create an INTERACTIVE task, which does not
# run unless Jason is logged on. A Windows Update reboot at 01:31 on 2026-08-12
# left the machine at the logon screen and cost 9.3 h: every task was
# Interactive, so even the watchdogs were down and nothing could report the
# outage. All 14 tasks were converted to S4U ("run whether the user is logged on
# or not", no stored password) that day.
#
# A watchdog that is itself Interactive is worse than useless: the scenario it
# exists to catch is the same scenario in which it does not run either, so the
# silence reads as "all clear".
#
# That conversion was manual, so without this block re-running this registrar
# for any unrelated reason silently reverts the task to Interactive and quietly
# re-opens the gap. The principal is the registrar's business now.
#
# Pasted rather than factored into a shared helper: these registrars are the
# bootstrap layer and are standalone on purpose (one that dot-sources a helper
# breaks when the helper moves), and the siblings needing the identical block
# live in other repos (mao-assembly, mao-scrape, MBFloodMapping) that a helper
# here could not reach anyway.
#
# NOT for mao-scrape's MAOSalesSearch / MAOSalesStaleness: those must STAY
# Interactive to read a DPAPI blob an S4U token cannot unlock - see their headers.
#
# Set-ScheduledTask -Principal requires ELEVATION; unelevated it throws
# "Access is denied." (verified 2026-08-12 under both 5.1 and pwsh 7). That is
# caught rather than fatal - the task is already registered above and stays
# usable - but it is reported loudly, because an Interactive task nobody
# noticed is the entire failure mode described above.
